                <p class = "content">
                    Halloween's origins can be traced to the Celtic festival of Samhain, which was celebrated around October 31st. The Celts, who lived in what is now Ireland, the United Kingdom, and parts of France, believed that on this day, the boundary between the living and the dead was blurred. They would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts.

                    In the first century AD, the Romans conquered the Celtic lands and blended their own festivals with Samhain. The Roman festival of Feralia, which commemorated the passing of the dead, and Pomona, a celebration of the Roman goddess of fruit and trees, are believed to have contributed to Halloween's traditions.

                    In medieval and Tudor England, people observed All Hallows' Eve with a tradition known as "souling." Poor individuals would go door to door, offering prayers for the dead in exchange for food. This practice eventually evolved into the modern-day custom of trick-or-treating.

                    By the early 20th century, Halloween in the United States had become a more community-centered holiday, with an emphasis on parties, parades, and costumes.
